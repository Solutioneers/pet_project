# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Backend

This project is a backend service for a Tic-Tac-Toe game, written in TypeScript and utilizing the Hono framework for creating serverless functions. The service is designed to manage game state and player interactions for games of Tic-Tac-Toe, making it possible for various frontends to interface with it to facilitate multiplayer gameplay.

## Features

- Create new game instances
- Join existing games
- Make moves within a game
- Check game state and winner
- List all games

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or pnpm

### Installation

Highly suggested that you get pnpm if you don't have it through here -> https://pnpm.io/installation

It's an npm alternative, it caches packages you download so you don't have to install them every time.

1. Install dependencies:
```
pnpm i
```
2. Run the project
```
pnpm dev
```

If you don't like to get `pnpm` you can use npm instead.
```
npm i

npm run dev
```

And now when you go over to `http://localhost:8787/` you should see a "Welcome Solutioneers!" page.
